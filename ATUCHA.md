**Total costs – estimates**
===========================

Total cost of the project consisting of one reactor (PHWR KWU design):

-   According to press release ([link](https://www.clarin.com/economia/atucha_ii_0_BJ7vH49D7g.html)) in Feb 2015
    
    -   Montamat also asked to "audit the accountants" responsible for the construction of Atucha II, since "the initial budget" for the work "was \$ 750 million and ended up costing \$4 billion."

-   According to press release ([link](https://www.clarin.com/economia/sorpresas-atucha-ii-servicio-tiempo-previsto_0_S1slOdAk-.html)):
    
    -   In Atucha II the former minister Julio de Vido noted that "a plant whose completion had to cost US \$ 700 million ended up costing US \$ 4,000 million." At the time of its tender in 1980, the total cost of Atucha II had been estimated at US \$ 1,881 million.

    -   The former president of NUCLEOELECTRICA ARGENTINA S. A., José Luis
    Antúnez, stated in **2013** that it was due to “the recovery of the
    purchasing power of wages in Argentina.”
        
    -   The original project contemplated a total cost of US \$1.9 billion.
    Completion was estimated at \$700 million and ended up costing more than
    \$3 billion.

    -   The government announced a \$3.5 billion strategic plan in August
    **2006** for the country's nuclear power sector, including completion of
Atucha 2.
    
-   According to Wikipedia ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atucha_Nuclear_Power_Plant))
    
    -   The total cost as of 2006 was estimated at US\$3.8 billion, or about
    \$5500/kWe.

A rough estimation of overnight cost can be derived:

-   \$ 5780/kW (based on \$4 bn & 692MW)

**Construction schedule: plans and changes – PRIS data**

**Construction schedule – grid date:**

-   Atucha 2: 14 Jul 1981 – 25 Jun 2014

**Construction schedule changes:**

-   According to World Nuclear Industry Status report ([link](https://www.worldnuclearreport.org/The-World-Nuclear-Industry-Status-Report-2019-HTML.html#fig58))
    
    -   Atucha-2 was ordered in 1979 and was listed as “under construction” in Construction was on and off for the next decades, but finally grid connection was announced on 27 June 2014. However, it took until 19 February 2015 for the unit to reach full capacity and until 26 May 2016 to enter commercial operation.
-   According to WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/argentina.aspx))
    
    -   Completing Atucha 2 was expected to cost \$600 million, including \$400 million for heavy water. Effective completion of Atucha 2 construction was in September 2011. The Neuquen heavy water plant completed production of 600 tonnes of heavy water in June 2012. This was loaded late in 2013, following the loading of the 451 fuel assemblies, each 9.76 metres long, which had commenced in December 2012. Local content is reported as about 90%. First criticality was achieved early in June 2014, and grid connection was later that month, with full power in February 2015. It entered commercial operation in May 2016. In August 2006, the government announced a \$3.5 billion strategic plan for the country's nuclear power sector. This involved completing Atucha 2 and extending the operating lifetimes of Atucha 1 and Embalse.
    
    -   The Siemens design of the Atucha PHWR units is unique to Argentina, and NA-SA was seeking expertise from Germany, Spain and Brazil to complete the unit. In 2003, plans for completing the 692 MWe Atucha 2 reactor (745 MWe gross) were presented to the government.
        
    -   In 1994, Nucleoeléctrica Argentina SA (NA-SA) was set up to take over the nuclear power plants from CNEA and oversee the continued construction of Atucha 2.
        
    -   In 1979, a third unit – Atucha 2, also known as Kirchner – was ordered following a government decision to have four more units coming into operation 1987-97. It was a Siemens design, a larger version of unit 1, and construction started in 1981 by a joint venture of CNEA and Siemens-KWU. However, work proceeded slowly due to lack of funds and was
    suspended in 1994 with the plant 81% complete.
