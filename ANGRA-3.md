**Total costs – estimates**
===========================

Total cost of the project consisting of one reactor (PRE KONVOI design):

-   According to WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/brazil.aspx)), current total cost is BRL 9.9 billion.

    -   Earlier in December 2010 Brazilian national development bank BNDES
    approved BRL 6.1 billion (\$ 3.6 billion) in financing for Angra 3, covering almost 60% of the then estimated cost of BRL 9.9 billion.

    -   In December 2012 state-owned Caixa Economica Federal bank agreed to lend BRL 3.8 billion (\$1.86 billion) to Eletrobras for completion of the unit. The total estimated cost was then \$7.59 billion.

**Construction schedule – current estimates:**

-   Angra 3: 01 Jun 2010 – 13 Sep 2025 (PRIS estimate)

**Construction schedule changes:**

-   According to press release ([link](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsbrazil-reconsiders-completion-of-angra-3-6956581)) in Jan 2019

    -   Brazilian Mines and Energy Minister Bento Albuquerque said on 23 January that Brazil hopes to complete its third nuclear plant by 2026, with the help of private investors. Construction of Angra 3 has been suspended since 2015.

-   According to WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/brazil.aspx))

    -   Angra 3 was designed to be a twin of unit 2. **Work started on the project in 1984 but was suspended in 1986 before full construction began.**

    -   In November 2006 the government announced plans to complete Angra 3 and also build four further 1000 MWe nuclear plants from 2015 at a single site. Angra 3 construction approval was confirmed by Brazil's National Energy Policy Council in June 2007 and received Presidential approval in July. Environmental approval was granted in March and all other approvals by July 2009. It will essentially be the same as unit 2 but with digital instrumentation and control systems. **In December 2008, Eletronuclear signed an industrial cooperation agreement with Areva, confirming that Areva will complete Angra 3 and be considered for supplying further reactors.** Areva also signed a services contract for Angra 1.

    -   First concrete for Angra 3 was in June 2010, closely following the construction licence from the National Nuclear Energy Commission (CNEN). **The plant was expected in operation at the end of 2015 after 66 months.** In November 2013, in line with the 2008 agreement, it awarded a €1.25 billion (\$1.7 billion) contract to Areva for engineering services and components, digital instrumentation and control system, supervision of installation works and commissioning of the unit. Two Brazilian consortia bid for installation contracts. One was for electro-mechanical assembly associated with the reactor’s primary system, valued at around BRL 1.31 billion (\$640 million), and another was for secondary-side work, estimated at BRL 1.67 billion (\$816 million). Both were awarded in February 2014. Local content is estimated at about 70%.

    -   **Following investigation in mid-2015, Eletrobras suspended both contracts.** In mid-2016 the investigations on use of funds involved Eletronuclear. After thatfunding ran out, halting the work and taking the construction schedule significantly beyond 2018. In January 2017 Eletronuclear formally annulled the electro-mechanical contract, having rejected appeals by companies Andrade Gutierrez, Camargo Correa, Queiroz Galvão, UTC, Techint, Odebrecht and EBE. The unit is about 70% completed.

    -   **At present, construction of Angra 3 is suspended.** In March 2017 the government announced that it planned to sell Angra 3 by 2018. The deputy energy minister said that Russian and Chinese investors had expressed interest, though Eletronuclear would be the operator. In July 2017 China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC) was reported to be interested, along with Rosatom, Kepco and a Mitsubishi-Areva consortium. In September 2017 an agreement with CNNC was signed to promote the construction of Angra 3 and future projects. This was followed up by the signing of similar agreements with Rosatom in November 2017 and EDF in June 2018.

    -   In November 2018 it was reported that Eletronuclear was negotiating with CNNC and State Power Investment Corp (SPIC), KEPCO, Rosatom, and a consortium comprising EDF with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries to complete the unit. A government estimate of BRL 15 billion (\$3.84 billion) cost was quoted. In October 2019 Eletronuclear announced that it had shortlisted CNNC, Rosatom and EDF as possible investors. In December 2019 Nuclebrás Equipamentos Pesados shipped the final condensor for the unit.
