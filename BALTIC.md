**Total costs – estimates**
===========================

Total cost of the project consisting of two reactors (Russian VVER V-491 design):

-   According to a governmental study from South Africa in 2013 ([link](http://www.energy.gov.za/IRP/2016/Study-of-the-cost-of-nuclear-power.pdf))

    -   On capital cost, the study takes the example of some projects: Baltic NPP: \$2.811 billion per gigawatt of installed capacity.

-   According to WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/russia-nuclear-power.aspx))

    -   The mid-2011 business plan estimated the likely capital cost to be €6.63 to 8.15 billion.
    
-   According to a review ([link](http://www.proatom.ru/modules.php?name=News&file=article&sid=3897)) in 2012
    
    -   According to 2010 estimate the cost of NPP construction was €4.8 bln and, including the infrastructure, €6.23 bln (RUB 255 bln) – based on 2012 exchange rate).

-   According to a press release in 2012 ([link](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN_Imminent_construction_of_Baltic_nuclear_power_plant_0802121.html))
    
    -   The cost of the two 1200 MWe reactors was put at \$6.8 billion in 2009.

A rough estimation of overnight cost is between **€2989/kW** to **€3674/kW** (based on 2011 data).

    -   Rosenergoatom decided to start the conservation project for the Baltic NPP for five years. According to the draft investment programme of Rosenergoatom at the website of Russian Ministry of Energy, it can spend up to RUB 464.45 mln on this project in 2019. Total costs of the conservation programme can be RUB 2.999 bln.

    -   Construction started at the Baltic-1 unit, a 1109 MW VVER-491 reactor, in February 2012. However, construction was suspended in June 2013 for a variety of reasons, including recognition of the limited market for the electricity.
