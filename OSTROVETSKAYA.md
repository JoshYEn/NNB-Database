**Total costs – estimates**
===========================

Total cost of the project consisting of two reactors (Russian VVER V-491 design):

-   According to press release ([link](https://eng.belta.by/president/view/belarusian-nuclear-power-plant-to-cost-less-than-10bn-120494-2019/)) in 2019 and [link2](https://rns.online/energy/Lukashenko-nazval-stoimost-stroitelstva-BelaES-2019-04-19/)
    
    -   Aleksandr Lukashenko said that the problem had been discussed at one of his meetings with President of Russia Vladimir Putin. The Belarusian head of state drew attention of his Russian counterpart to the fact that the Belarusian-Russian credit agreement provides for lending up to \$10 billion while the real price will be less than \$7 billion. “The cost of the nuclear power plant will be lower. We will see it once all things are done. But I've mentioned this figure to Vladimir Putin once,” Aleksandr Lukashenko said.
    
    -   The president stressed that he had publicly mentioned these facts after one of the MPs quoted the Russian ambassador saying Russia had reduced the cost of construction of the Belarusian nuclear power plant by \$3 billion. “Russia didn't reduce the price for the nuclear power plant. If the ambassador said that, the statement harms Russia,” Aleksandr Lukashenko stressed. “It is a commercial secret. The contract price shouldn't be made public,” he explained.
    -   The head of state added that the Belarusian nuclear power plant will also be cheaper because spending is closely overseen.
    
-   October 2018 ([link](https://belaruspartisan.by/economic/440887/))

    -   By July 1, 2018 USD 3 bln were used from Russian credit. Over all 2018 it was expected that USD 1.3 bln would be used. In 2019-2020 it was planned to use USD 2.5 bln from the credit.
        
    -   By 2020 it was planned to use USD 6.4 bln from Russian credit that covers 90% of construction costs (i.e., total costs were planned to be at the level of USD 7 bln).

-   According to press release ([link](https://belsat.eu/ru/news/stoimost-belorusskoj-aes-rastet/) *and* [link2](https://news.tut.by/economics/521699.html)) in 2016
    
    -   The parties decided to increase the construction costs of the BelNPP by 8.92 billion rubles at the base price level, or by 50.6 billion rubles at the prices of the 1st quarter of 2016 (appr \$ 675 million at the average exchange rate of the Russian ruble for the 1st quarter in dollars
    
    -   Two years ago, the deputy director of the Belarusian NPP Andrei Barkun said that the cost of BelAES would not exceed \$ 11 billion ([link](https://naviny.by/rubrics/economic/2014/11/26/ic_news_113_449553)). Shortly before this statement, it became known that Russia would provide Belarus with a loan of up to \$ 10 billion for the construction of nuclear power plants.
    
-   According to WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/belarus.aspx))
    
    -   In June 2009, Belarus official cost estimate including infrastructure was \$9.4 billion, with one third of this to be spent 2011-15.
    -   Belarus used [INPRO’s](https://www.iaea.org/publications/10583/inpro-assessment-of-the-planned-nuclear-energy-system-of-belarus)**\*** Nuclear Energy Systems Assessment methodology covering economics, infrastructure, waste management, proliferation resistance, physical protection, environment, and safety to confirm its investment decision. The results showed that nuclear would be competitive, with overnight costs \$1960/kW and levelized electricity price 5.81 cent/kWh (compared with coal \$1175/kW and 6.52 cent/kWh, and gas \$805/kW and 6.76 cent/kWh). The basic overnight cost of the two units was put at **\$6.135 billion**.
    
    -   **\*** The International Project on Innovative Nuclear Reactors and Fuel Cycles (INPRO) was developed by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).

December 2015 ([link](https://atom.belta.by/ru/belaes_ru/view/belaes_ru/view/stoimost-oborudovanija-dlja-belorusskoj-aes-otsenivaetsja-v-3-mlrd-7246/t_id/1)):

-   Costs of equipment for Belarusian NPP is estimated at appr USD 3 bln.

-   Cost of reactor and turbine island is estimated at the level of USD 1.6 bln.

-   Level of localization: Belarusian companies produce 7.5% of equipment for
    the NPP.

**Construction schedule: plans and changes – estimates**
========================================================

**Construction schedule – current estimates:**

-   BELARUSIAN 1: 08 Nov 2013 – 2020 (WNA statistics: [link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/belarus.aspx))

-   BELARUSIAN 2: 27 Apr 2014 – 2021 (WNA statistics: [link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-a-f/belarus.aspx))

**Construction schedule changes:**

-   According to WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-g-n/japan-nuclear-power.aspx))

    -   In April 2013 Atomenergomash (AEM) won the tender to supply the two reactors, which are being manufactured by AEM-Technologies at the Atommash plant at Volgodonsk. In October 2013 Gosatomnadzor (GAN) issued the Nuclear Power Plant Construction Directorate (Belarus AEC) with a licence for the construction of the first reactor at the Ostrovets site. First concrete was in November 2013, with VNIPIET (formerly SPbAEP) as main contractor, though the full construction licence was not issued until April 2014. A construction licence for the base mat of unit 2 was issued by the ministry in February 2014. Construction of unit 2 started in May 2014, several months ahead of schedule. The full construction licence was issued at the end of December 2014. **The construction time for the first unit was expected to be 60 months, with grid connection of the unit initially due in November 2018.**

    -   In September 2015 the prime minister ordered relevant ministries and the Minsk executive to allocate the required number of qualified workers to “eliminate delays to construction and installation work” so that the project remains on schedule. **In July 2016 the unit 1 reactor pressure vessel (RPV) slipped out of sling when being moved and hit the ground, apparently without being damaged.** OKB Gidropress and Atomstroyexport in August inspected the RPV and sent the results of that to the Belarusian Nuclear Power Plant Company – and to Gosatomnadzor. However, the Belarus government said that it wanted it replaced, and Rosatom responded that it would do so, later making it clear that this was a public acceptance matter rather than a technological issue implying any safety issue. **The RPV for unit 2 is now being used in unit 1, incurring about a six-month delay in construction but no extra cost for the customer, and the original RPV will be used elsewhere.** The new one was shipped from Atommash in Volgodonsk late in October 2016, and in April 2017 it was agreed that the RPV intended for Baltic 1 and made by Atommash would be sent to Belarus for unit 2.

    -   Commissioning work on unit 1 by Atomstroyexport commenced in April 2019. Construction of unit 1 has been completed and in February 2020 hot functional tests were under way. Construction of unit 2, as of February 2020, is 70% completed. Belarus NPP will operate the plant.
