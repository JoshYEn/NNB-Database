**Total costs – estimates**
===========================

Total cost of the project consisting of four reactors (Korean APR1400 design):

-   According to MIT ‘[The Future of Nuclear Energy in a Carbon-Constrained World](http://energy.mit.edu/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/The-Future-of-Nuclear-Energy-in-a-Carbon-Constrained-World.pdf)’
    (2018) the total cost for the reactors was **\$18.6 billion** based on KEPCO Investor Presentation in December 2016.
    -   This means that the reported price for the reactors was planned to be **\$3,457 per kilowatt of electrical generating capacity** (kWe) – based on 5,380 GW capacity of the 4 units.
    
    -   For \$18.6 bln number no specific details were provided on what is included in this figure. According to MIT analysis, it is likely to exclude owners costs that could add up to 20% extra (i.e., over \$3.7 bln) putting total costs (to be comparable with other figures) to **\$22.3 bln**.
    -   Additional estimates cited by MIT based on different press reports:
    
        -   \$20 bln
        -   \$25 bln
    
        -   \$30 bln
    
        -   \$40 bln – from Korea Herald, June 20, 2015
    
-   Aug 2018: The UAE plans to bring a total of four nuclear reactors into operation by 2021 at a cost of **\$25 billion**, producing a combined 5,600 megawatts of power.

-   April 2018: according to the [ETI Nuclear Cost Drivers Project](https://d2umxnkyjne36n.cloudfront.net/documents/D7.3-ETI-Nuclear-Cost-Drivers-Summary-Report_April-20.pdf?mtime=20180426151016) total capital cost of Barakah 1-4 is approximately **\$3,700 per kilowatt of electrical generating capacity (kWe)**.
    
    -   ETI report: the turnkey contract for the Barakah project had a total price of \$20.4 billion, including funding for construction of a port facility and other project infrastructure
    
    -   According to ETI estimates, significant cost reductions were achieved due to multi-unit efficiencies factor: CAPEX with interest during construction (IDC) for Barakah Unit-4 (extrapolated) is estimated to be 2,300 per kilowatt of electrical generating capacity (kWe), i.e. 40% less cost than the overall site average
    
-   Mar 2018: The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) has completed construction of the unit 1, with 1,400MW capacity, at the **\$32bn** Barakah nuclear power plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. Construction of the project’s units 2 is 92% complete, unit 3 is 81% complete, and unit 4 is 66% complete.

-   Oct 2016: The total cost of the project is at least **€24.4 billion (US\$28.2 billion)**. The financing for this was US\$16.2 billion Abu Dhabi’s Department of Finance, equity financing US\$4.7 billion, US\$2.5 billion through a loan from the Export-Import Bank of Korea, with loan agreements from the National Bank of Abu Dhabi, First Gulf Bank, HSBC and Standards Charter making up the remainder.

No data available.

**Cost drivers**
================

According to the [ETI Nuclear Cost Drivers Project](https://d2umxnkyjne36n.cloudfront.net/documents/D7.3-ETI-Nuclear-Cost-Drivers-Summary-Report_April-20.pdf?mtime=20180426151016) the following factors positively affected low costs for Barakah NPP:

-   **Vendor Plant Design**: the UAE selected the KEPCO consortium partly because of successful recent projects in Korea. The UAE did not want to experiment with an unproven design or one with a less successful track record.
    
-   **Labour**: KEPCO management was very committed to winning the UAE contract. There is a focus on key goals and incremental improvement among KEPCO’s top executives. The consortium has adjusted shift systems to enhance efficiency.
    
-   **Project Governance and Project Development**: Barakah’s success is tied directly to the way the RfP was structured and carried out. The bidding process was intentionally designed to avoid as many of the past mistakes as possible. The KEPCO consortium shows the value of clear responsibility and authority under the prime contractor.

**Construction schedule: plans and changes – estimates**
========================================================

**Construction schedule – current estimates:**

-   Barakah 1: 19 Jul 2012 – early 2020 ([link](https://www.thenational.ae/business/energy/barakah-nuclear-project-aims-for-early-2020-startup-of-first-unit-1.962856))
    
-   Barakah 2: 16 Apr 2013 – Unknown

-   Barakah 3: 24 Sep 2014 – Unknown

-   Barakah 4: 30 Jul 2015 – Unknown

**Construction schedule changes:**

-   February 2020: The independent nuclear regulator for the United Arab Emirates on Monday (February 17) issued the operating license for Unit 1 of the country’s Barakah Nuclear Power Plant, giving the go-ahead on operations for the first nuclear power plant in the Arab world ([link](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/17/uae-gets-green-light-to-operate-the-arab-worlds-first-nuclear-power-plant.html)).
    
-   January 2020: The Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (Enec) expects loading of the first nuclear fuel assemblies into unit 1 of the Barakah nuclear plant under construction in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) to take place in the first quarter of 2020, local media reported ([link](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsmore-delays-for-barakah-nuclear-plant-7591655))
    
-   January 2020: Barakah 1 was initially scheduled to load fuel in August 2017. Still, in May 2017 Enec said start-up would be postponed to 2018 to allow sufficient time for international assessments, and “as a reinforcement of operational proficiency for plant personnel”. This followed evaluations and lessons learned from Shin-Kori 3 in South Korea, which is the reference plant for Barakah. Construction of Barakah 1 was completed in March 2018, and fuel loading was then set for May 2018 ([link](https://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsmore-delays-for-barakah-nuclear-plant-7591655)).
    
-   May 2018: The UAE’s first nuclear power plant will not begin generating electricity until the end of 2019, or possibly even 2020, its operator has said ([link](https://www.thenational.ae/uae/uae-s-first-nuclear-power-plant-delayed-until-late-2019-or-2020-1.734445))
