**Total costs – estimates**
===========================

Total cost of the project consisting of two reactors (Russian VVER V-412design):

-   According to press releases and WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/russia-nuclear-power.aspx))
    
    -   December 2019: costs of floating NPP ‘Akademik Lomonosov’ that took 10 years to construct are USD 232 million ([link](https://inosmi.ru/economic/20191221/246491345.html))
    -   In Sep 2019, the total cost of the Pevek installation will not be disclosed until the project is complete, but Rosatom said the technology is "strongly competitive". ([link](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Russias-floating-plant-reaches-final-destination))
    
    -   February 2017: SOGAZ insurance company insured ‘Akademik Lomonosov’ on RUB 21.7 billion, and considering the costs of coastal infrastructure total project costs may reach RUB 28.7 billion ([link](https://www.atomic-energy.ru/news/2017/02/14/72670)).
    
    -   October 2016: the costs of the first floating NPP in the world as estimated at the level of RUB 30 billion ([link](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2016/10/05/659659-stoimost-plavuchei-aes)).
    
    -   In May 2015, total estimated costs for Pevek increased to RUR 37 billion (\$740 million) at May 2015, partly due to factoring in the required site works and infrastructure. The government is contributing to this coastal infrastructure, with RUR 5 billion over 2016-20. The pilot FNPP itself is costing Rosenergoatom RUR 21.5 billion, and it expects the second one to be about RUR 18 billion.

    -   In Dec 2012, after the delay caused by shipyard, the cost of completing the FNPP was then put at RUR 7.631 billion (\$248 million). ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/russia-nuclear-power.aspx))
    
    -   In July 2009, Rosenergoatom signed a RUR 9.98 billion (\$239 million) purchase contract for the floating plant for Vilyuchinsk, on the Kamchatka Peninsula in the Far East. ([link](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-floating-plant-to-be-delivered-in-2016-23101401.html))
    -   In Apr 2007, it is estimated that the plant will cost around six billion roubles (\$232 million) to build. ([link](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/Articles/Russian-floating-reactor-construction-starts))

**Costs of main components**
============================

September 2016 ([link](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2016/10/05/659659-stoimost-plavuchei-aes)):

-   Cost of floating NPP are estimated at the level of RUB 22 billion

-   Costs of coastal infrastructure – above RUB 7 billion

No data available.

**Construction schedule: plans and changes – PRIS data**
========================================================

**Construction schedule – current estimates:**

-   AKADEMIK LOMONOSOV-1: 15 Apr 2007 – 19 Dec 2019

-   AKADEMIK LOMONOSOV-1: 15 Apr 2007 – 19 Dec 2019

**Construction schedule changes:**

-   According to press release ([link](https://www.world-nuclear-news.org/NN-floating-plant-to-be-delivered-in-2016-23101401.html)) and WNA statistics ([link](https://www.world-nuclear.org/information-library/country-profiles/countries-o-s/russia-nuclear-power.aspx))
    
    -   December 2018: first reactor unit was launched ([link](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2019/12/19/819169-rossii-zarabotala-plavuchaya-stantsiya))
    
    -   Summer 2016: mooring tests started on floating NPP ([link](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2019/12/19/819169-rossii-zarabotala-plavuchaya-stantsiya))
    -   The two reactors were installed in October 2013.
    
    -   In 2012 the plant was re-assigned to Pevek in the far northeast of Siberia.
    -   In 2010 the floating power plant was launched on water ([link](https://www.vedomosti.ru/business/articles/2019/12/19/819169-rossii-zarabotala-plavuchaya-stantsiya))
    
    -   In 2009, the 2x35 MWe Academician Lomonosov was due to be completed in 2011 and commissioned in 2012, but the project was delayed due to shipyard insolvency.
    
    -   New keel-laying took place in May 2009 and the two reactors were delivered from OKBM Afrikantov by August. The 21,500 tonne hull - 144 metres long, 30 m wide - was launched at the end of June 2010.
    
    -   The keel of Academician Lomonosov was laid in April 2007 at Sevmash in Severodvinsk, but in August 2008 Rosatom cancelled the contract - apparently due to the military workload at Sevmash - and transferred it to the Baltiysky Zavod shipyard, which has experience in building nuclear icebreakers.
